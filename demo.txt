# How to Verify Testimonials & Use Admin Features

This guide explains how to verify the testimonial system works correctly.

## 1. Submitting a Testimonial (Client View)
1.  Go to the **Client Success** section on the homepage.
2.  Click the **"Add Testimonial"** button.
3.  Fill in the form:
    *   **Name**: e.g., "John Doe"
    *   **Role**: e.g., "CEO, Tech Corp"
    *   **Feedback**: "Amazing work on the AI agent!"
4.  Click **Submit**.
5.  **Result**: You should see a success message. The testimonial **will not appear yet** on the public page because it is pending approval.

## 2. Checking Email Notifications (Admin View)
*   **Action**: Immediately after submission, check your email inbox (`sales.nadeem10@gmail.com`).
*   **Result**: You should receive an email with the subject "New Testimonial Submitted - Action Required" containing the feedback details.
*   *(Note: This requires `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_PASS` to be set correctly in your `.env.local` file).*

## 3. Approving Testimonials (Admin Panel)
1.  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
2.  **Login**: Enter the password `nadeem123`.
3.  **Dashboard**: You will see a list of testimonials.
    *   Look for the one you just submitted. It should have a yellow **"Pending"** tag.
4.  **Action**: Click the **Green Checkmark Button** next to it.
5.  **Result**: The status will change to a green **"Approved"** tag.

## 4. Verifying Public Display
1.  Go back to the homepage (`http://localhost:3000`).
2.  Scroll down to **Client Success**.
3.  **Result**: The new testimonial from "John Doe" should now be visible!

## 5. Deleting Testimonials
1.  Go back to the Admin Dashboard.
2.  Click the **Red Trash Icon** next to any testimonial.
3.  **Result**: It will be permanent removed from the system and the website.

**Troubleshooting**
*   If you don't receive emails: Check if your Gmail "App Password" is correct in `.env.local`.
*   If data isn't saving: Restore `data/testimonials.json` to a valid JSON array `[]` if it got corrupted.
